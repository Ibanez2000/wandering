    <h1>Yilan to Taipei - The best experience on the Taiwan bicycle loop!</h1>
    <p>2023/10/27</p>

    
    <p>Today was going to be a big day for my German and French friends. Both of them would finish their Taiwan
        bicycle loop by arriving at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SsUPgcNDAvdxDMMT6>">Taipei Songshan Railway
            station</a>, the official starting and ending point of the
        official No. 1 bicycle route.
    </p>

    <div class="textbox">
        <h2>GPS Route</h2>
        
            <i class="fa-solid fa-route fa-lg" style="color: #608180;"></i>

        <p>The route follows provincial highway No. 2 省道 and then provincial highway No. 2 Old （2丙）to Keelung City,
            from
            there
            it is Cycling Route No. 1 to Taipei Central).</p>

    </div>


    <p>The weather report announced some light rain in the morning and otherwise clear weather for this day, so my
        German friend and I set out at about 7:30 in the morning from Hualian.
    </p>

    <p>
        We decided to skip bicycling the part between Hualian and Yilan and take a slow train instead. I had biked
        two small sections of it two days before (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/irTHtx2KHFTQHGoi8">Dongao</a> to
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wK1kxDhTBbnf1ThA8">Nanfangao</a> and <a href=""
            https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q5zefm4qnozVw2g59>Xincheng</a> to <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ANWqE18RvPbgAGwW9">Changde</a>) and the judgement was
        that while this part is one of the most scenic areas to bike within the loop, it was just not worth the road
        safety risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        Starting from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zU3UryhwohNZQYaR9">Yilan train station</a> we first set out
        to pick up my French friend at the small town of Toucheng
        where he stayed for a few days to wait out the rainy weather and passed the time by learning how to surf
        waves.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/oeL9iiZQ6CDvynFi6">Toucheng</a> is a great place for learning to surf with
        wonderful beaches. A private surfing lesson for two
        hours with an extra person to take pictures and videos can be had for about 1.200 TWD per person there.
        That's the lowest price I have heard of in Taiwan.

        After picking him up we proceeded to drive along the coastline. While not as stunning as the part between
        Hualian an Yilan, it is special in its own way as there is big rock formations that go deep into the water
        with lots of spectacular wave breaking there and few tourists.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our friend suggested a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/5a2EBSJX82nW5zR4A">Bento Box place at Fulong train
            station</a> that we would
        reach early at around 11:00am, while not yet really
        hungry we agreed for the stop since we already had done a lot of kilometers. By some navigational hick-ups,
        we arrived at the Bento Box place at a small train station and decided to pump up the tubes of our bikes in
        the small town before heading into the mountains where no such opportunity would exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here we learned that electric compressor machines do not produce enough pressure for racing bike tires
        (about 8 bar needed). So bike and scooter rental stores will usually be willing to help out, but ultimately
        cannot. Luckily there was a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kBpJgWrQqyPd1a437">police station</a> that
        gladly lent us their manual bike pump and even handed us a
        few bottles of drinking water for free!

    </div>

    <p>
        After the one hour rest, we left the Provincial Highway No. 2 )with a sharp left turn and headed into the
        mountains on Provincial Highway No. 2 Old （2丙). Our French friend insisted that we would take a slightly
        different route that we originally planned as that way we would go up a beautiful mountain.


    </p>

    <p>
        On this road we passed the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/x5FRvkcqLMrGY4J59">Pingshuangshuidao 平雙隧道</a>
        tunnel.


    </p>


    <p>
        The climb in the beginning was pretty tough, almost down to the speed where you think about pushing the bike
        instead (which is actually harder than keeping to bike in the lowest gear as you are not used to walking
        anymore during the loop). However as hard as it was (the German friend and I fell way behind), it is only
        for a short time and afterwards there is lots of sweet downhill time.


    </p>

    <p>What happened afterwards is what I will call the topping of the cake of the whole Taiwan loop as it is only
        downhills from there on all the way to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tUh8tUqGGBH9FpzcA">Keelung</a> (a
        part of Taipei).



    </p>

    <p>
        First you will pass a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZqYiDSfhg4FQQR967">majestic bridge</a> that spans
        over a huge valley and then you will enter a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cG6Sz6DW5GvHJLQ6">mountain
            tunnel (Jiping Suidao 基平隧道）</a> that just never seemed to end. There are no curves in it and when we
        passed we
        were the only people there. It's just downhill and it feels surreal!
    </p>

    <div class="videobox">

        <iframe width=70% height="400" align="center"

            allowfullscreen></iframe>

    </div>

    <p>
        After you get spit out of the tunnel, you go down a bunch of hairpin curves, arguably the most fun place to
        bike down and then suddenly you arrive Keelung city and the first MRT station BaDu of Taipei.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sun was starting to set down, and we agreed to push on for central Taipei to arrive before the sky went
        black. The navigation system showed 50 km remaining (at that time we already had about 70km on the clock),
        so it should roughly take 1-2 hours. We were wrong about this estimate and it got dark quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keelung resembles what I would call a cyber punk city. Building seem old and build in the old 70s style of
        Hong Kong, theres green nature reclaiming a lot of it and everything is build into the mountains. There's
        small alleys and bridges everywhere while big trucks thunder next to you. We pretty much got lost in those
        small alleys, already feeling our energy fading and getting stressed out from all the pollution and noise of
        the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luckily later we found a walking/bicycling path next to a river that took us almost all the way to Taipei
        city center. There within thousands of scooters passing by us, we arrived at SongShan station, saw <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hdKX7d4a8jPDv75SA">Taipei
            101 </a>.The 101 was once the highest building in the world, and in my opinion is still one of the
        prettiest skyscrapers!.
    </p>
    <p>
        After getting mixed up in all the people coming of work from the office buildings, we found ourselves
        between the big shopping centers of this metropolis. Quite the contrast to the peaceful mountains with
        buddhist temples and the coastline we had been just a few hours before!
    </p>

    <p>
        At about 8:00pm, everyone got to their accommodations and enjoyed a highly deserved shower after 115km of
        bicycling (a personal record for myself).

        This night I stayed in the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9CrqbPv2ijfJPB6k9">小角落青旅咖啡 Corner Hostel &
            Cafe</a> that i can highly recommend for stays in Taipei.
